In case you are as lost as I was during first 1-2 weeks of the Data Science course, this tutorial is for you! I promise you won't be so lost anymore. 
To be honest, it is not so overwhelming once you know what are you doing.</div>


There are just few things you need to be ready for: 

- RStudio likes to not cooperate with you very often but try to avoid breakdowns, it will work somehow

- There will be a lot things to do during the semester, but you can do it! 

- They will be telling you its a lot of fun and you may not agree (especially when your R decides to not work) but it can be fun too

## 1. What is R?

You have probably heard already about some of the programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, C, Java... R is also one of them. Actually, in 2021 it was the 8th most useful programming language with annual salary of  $93,000 [(Northeastern.edu)](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/). It is used mostly for statistical analysis of large data sets and companies like Facebook. Google, New York Times or BBC, Twitter or Microsoft use it. 


To download R, follow 1st part of this [tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/). 

Now, letâ€™s have a look how the R looks like: 





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
